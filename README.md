# a05annexRobot

The A05annex base library for a Swerve Drive Base with NavX, autonomous paths with actions, and selection of
autonomous path (there are generally many possible paths depending on field start position and alliance strategy)
and driver preferences (drivers are conditioned by the games they play, the driver preference lets the driver natch
the robot response to their favorite game).

## Creating a Robot Project Using this Library

To use this a05annexRobot base library, create a WPI robot project and make these modifications:
* Add these libraries to the newly created WPI robot project:
  * create a /lib directory, and copy .....
  * Adjust the *build.gradle* to -------


## Robot Swerve Drive

This project base assumes we are using a
[swerve drive specialties MK4 drive](https://www.swervedrivespecialties.com/products/mk4-swerve-module?variant=39376675143793)
swerve drive base. The specifics of the base geometry are ***VERY*** important in getting this software to correctly
control the drive, and the motor controllers and encoders must have the CAN bus IDs as shown below

## NavX
